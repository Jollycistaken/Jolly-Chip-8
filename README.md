# About

A Chip-8 emulator, still being worked on, so it's not perfect\
Currently implements imgui-rs to have a good looking ui for the debugger and etc
Currently only supports the Original Chip-8 Variant, but I will add others soon

## Todo
- All the todos listed in the comments
- Add some other variants
- Enable docking in imgui-rs
- Add Keypad UI
- Add Debugging and Disassembler
- Add Assembler

## Making your own
I used https://chip8.gulrak.net/ and https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/ for learning Chip-8 and its variants\
These are also code free so you can challenge yourself and make one without looking at any emulator code
